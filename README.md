# RPi Trash Sorter

This project uses a Raspberry Pi with computer vision to classify items as **trash** or **recycling** and control servos to open the corresponding bin.  

## Current Status
- Planning to use a MobileNet-based classifier  
- Hardware and model integration work in progress  

## Dataset (potentially)
- [Kaggle Garbage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2)

## Planned Features
- Camera capture and preprocessing  
- Trash vs. recycling classification  
- Servo control for bin lids  
- Logging and optional web interface  

## Setup
- Model will be exported as TFLite for Raspberry Pi  

## Usage
- Currently working on the prototype
